# leesin-stick-animation
Simple flash animation which demonstrates buttons triggering events

---

This short flash animation was a project I created for a class in high school during 2016. It references the very popular mutliplayer online battle arena game League of Legends and its character Lee Sin. This file can be viewed through a swift file manager or any web browser that supports flash animation.
