### Description: This is a simple flash animation which demonstrates buttons triggering events, I created this for a class in high school during 2016. It references the *very popular* mutliplayer\-online\-battle\-arena game "League of Legends" and one of its characters: Lee Sin. This file can be viewed through a swift file player or any web browser that supports flash animation.

but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times."
